Business Intelligence (BI) refers to the technologies, processes, and practices used to collect, integrate, analyze, and present business data,
to help executives, managers, and other corporate end users make informed business decisions. 
The main goal of BI is to support better business decision-making.

Key Components--
Data Warehousing: Centralized repositories that store data from various sources.
ETL (Extract, Transform, Load): Processes that extract data from different sources, 
transform it into a suitable format, and load it into a data warehouse.
Data Integration: Combining data from multiple sources to provide a unified view.
Data Analysis: Using statistical and analytical tools to interpret data.
Reporting and Visualization: Creating dashboards and reports to present data insights.

Power BI
Tableau
QlikView

Applications:

Performance metrics and benchmarking
Sales and market analysis
Financial and operational reporting

Data Mining
Definition: Data mining is basically extraction of data from warehouse at a very basic level.

Analytical Processing is a category of software tools that provides analysis of data 

Development --the development of analytical applications and dashboards.


Imagine a retail company leveraging BI to understand their sales performance:

BI: The company uses a BI tool like Power BI to aggregate sales data from various sources (e.g., online, in-store).
Data Mining: They apply data mining techniques to uncover patterns, such as identifying that customers 
		who buy baby products are likely to also buy skincare items.
Analytical Processing: They use OLAP to drill down into sales data, analyzing performance by region, 
		time period, and product category, enabling them to make informed decisions about inventory and marketing strategies.
Development: The company's IT team develops ETL processes to ensure data from different sources
		 is accurately and efficiently loaded into the data warehouse.
Visualization: They create dashboards in Power BI to visualize sales trends, monitor KPIs, and communicate insights to stakeholders.


When we launch power bi-- after welcome 
screen, the 1st scrreen that we see is Power view.
Data view+model view is Power Pivot.
Next is Power query editor for transformations on data.
Power map component we will see during visualization.
To enable power visualization--
file-- options and settings--security--
tick it to enable power map component.

Power bi desktop import all these components.
Power Q&A--answer questions asked in nlp.

ETL def in power bi--
extract transform load.

extract data from multiple sources,
clean or transform data
and then loading the transformed data to visualize data using charts and build dashboard.


So now transforming data using Power query editor for clening data.

Clean and transform data
Using transform data option, query editor allows us to clean and transform data like,
• Merging column
• Splitting column
• Renaming column
• Changing the data type of column
• Change table name
• Removing null values
• Removing duplicate values and many more…

Data -- car sale, car details, car supply mgmt, sample superstore

get data-->
there are diff sources to upload adta from.
-- US regionalsale data.xlsx---------------------------------- Share with students to see the data

So whatever sheets are present in mu excel workbook they all i will see.

lets say selecting top 6 tables,
Now we have 2 options. We can load data directly or transform data and then load.

So for no load.

Explore the loaded table.
In the table view u will see the tables.

Model view-- see the relationships in the dataset.

Now loading data from csv files--
get data-->text/csv--> car details-->load

Goto model view and see car and sales have no relationship.

get data-->web--> wikipedai sachin tendulkar-->ok
different tables-->runs wins tendulkar's international centuries -- load

model view-->see-- we can even establish relationships. We can change col name to transform col name.

If u want to load data from transform tab-->then--> new source--> and load data.

Now if u want to transform directly and not load--> then close power bi--> start-->transform--> text/csv--> car details v3--> loading

load another 2-->car sales--> ok
load-->car supply chain mgmt-->ok

Queries tab show the different data or tables available.

Next to query tab is a table view portion.
Where u can see columns and rows in a table.

Then, query settings contain properties and applied steps.

From properties change the name to Car_SupplyChainManagement

the name of the table will be changed and u will also see in applied steps.

Then u have ribbion on top and different tabs on it.

I u dont want to see formula bar -- untick it
tick column quantity and see.-- it is telling about valid data +nt, error and empty data.

This 3rd table contains all valid data,
but if u will see car details, it has empty rows.

we generraly spend time in home, transform and add column tab.

Next we need to transform our data which is a power query editor.


In car sales we have more empty data.

In car sales we have empty data.

So null values we either drop or impute i.e. fill with some data.

So our goal is to make data ready for visualization.

click car sales-- 
now in the applied steps u can see . pbi has already performed some data manipulation. I f
u want u can remove those steps.

Cancel those steps and u see ure raw data.
Home tab-->use first row as headers.
here it is applying datatype according to data 
the column contains.

See the ppt-- analysis using query editor.

Clean and transform are some steps that we apply.

1. merging cols into one-->we have transform tab and add column tab which have
some common options. The difference bet them is 
if we r doing it through transform col, then that col will change but in add col section new col is added at the end of the table.

Merge col-- select atleast 2 cols

so transform tab-->select 1st 2 cols of --> 
merge cols (near format ABC)-- give seperator-->
i can select from given seperators, or
i can add custom eg underscore,--> then new col name-->Manufacturer_Model

Now both the 2 cols are gone and new col appeared.
If u want to go back then from applied steps ->remove this step--

so next we will do same with add col option--
See at the end new col has been added.

remove this step.

Next is splitting cols-->

home tab-->split cols--

click 3rd table-->car suppply-->supplier contavct details-->by delimiter-->each occurence--ok

remove the steps then.

Next is renaming col--> so right click SupplierName col-->name-->ok
 U can even double click and rename it.

Change datatype-- car price-- fixed decimal,decimal u can change.

U can rename table by right click or from query seetings .

car sale-->__year_resale_value--> remove underscore-->enter

Theres no way to bring the cancelled step from applied steps. U will have to do the proces again.


removing null values-- remove or impute.

Now cars sale-->year_resale_value--> 23% empty data-->which is alot. --> dropdown-->remove empty

cancel this step

So now seeing imputing--> year_resale_value
--> dropdown--> select nulls-->now right click on any null-->replace values-->since its datatype is deciaml
--> so 0.0--ok

for text u can put NA
removing duplicate values

now what we can see is only replaced data.
so what u can do is in applied steps drag replaced value and put it before filterd rows-->
remove filterd row step.

or u can directly right click on null value in a col-- replace with 0.0--ok and all the values will be replaced.

for single data change u need to go back to excel remove their.

then  go to car details v3-->engine-->blank cell-->
right click--> NA

Same with mileage col-->replace with 0.0 kmpl
Or u can write NA.-->NA

Now removing duplicates--> consider complete table--> see complete row to check for duplicates.

So for selecting complet table--> 1st click 1 col--> then do ctrl+A
now right click on any col--> remove duplicates.

same for car sale

Next is merging--
like left join, right join, inner join, full outer join.

1 common col is required.

If common col is not there then merging is not possible.

In home tab we have merge quer and append query.

Select car sale-->append queries-->now in dropdown there are 2 options in append query-->
in car sales table only changes will be applied.
So, click on append query--->car details v3-->
Now scroll to end-- wherever values are not there-->null

Now tryiong merge query as new--
click on car supply-->merge queries as new-->car sale-->same col--in car supply we have car maker
and in car sale we have manufacturer--> their values are same-->so from both tables click on these cols.--> inner join--> ok
So the matching values will come as output in merge1.

Now adding add columns--

1. col from example--> from selection--> click supplier addr and supplier name, car maker--> write in a cell Dodge-542 Dayton Center-Bubbletube-- enter--ok now this col is added.

next cancel --col from egs from all cols-->and write some values from some cols --> ok

Next custom cols--car sale-->new col name--> sales per price--> double click sales_in thousands--[Sales_in_thousands]/[Price_in_thousands]-->ok

next is invoke custom func--> here u can write ur 
own custom func and apply it on ur own col-->
So before using this functionality u will write some func--> so right click on query tab--> 
new query--> blank query--> = (sales as number,price as number) => sales+price

now our func is created--> now click car sale-->
invoke custom func-->new col name--> addition-->query1--> here u can give col or a particular value-->put 10, 20--> so our o/pis 30.

u can even add cols-- sales in thousand, price in thousand.

then we will see about conditional col, index col and duplicate col.

1. Duplicate cols--

lets say car details-->year--> duplicate col-->at the end new col year_copy will 
be created --> rename it to-->year1 or something.

Next is index col--> 2 options from 0 or 1-->
for 0 1st row will be 0, 2nd 1...
for 1 1st row will be 1, 2nd 2....

so this can also server as unique col or primary key.

just click index col--> from 1

conditional col-->so it is based on some conditions.
--> car sales--> manufactures--> we can have some condition like
if manufactureer name is accura give me 20 somrthing like that.

if--> col name--> manufacturer-->operator equals-->
value Acura-->then o/p 20--> add clause-->
Manufacturer--> equls to--> BMW-->50-- add clause--
Manufacturer--> equls to--> Audi-->100

else 150--ok
we can keep the col name as New Manufacturer Limit

Here u can also o/p a col based on condition--
so conditional col-->
Manufacturer--> equls to--> BMW-->clcik dropdown on o/p-->
select a col--> col name Latest_Launch-->
and for else I want anothe col-->HorsePower

So here what will happen , wherever manyfacturer is BMW,
the value will be coming from Latest Launch, otherwise 
from horsepower.

Now few other functionalities present in add col--
next to format--> extract 
so click on manufacturer--> extract-->lenght--> we have new col at the end.

Now removing all these steps.

then format option is also ther--> manufacturer--> 
format--> upper case--> new col addded

fuel capacity--> scientific
-->square-->new col

Now cancel all the steps. WE will exit our power query edior now.

home--> close and apply-->then whatever will be present in query tab
will be present there.-->

If u dont want to load everything then right click on name in query editor-->
untick enable load option. And that will not be loaded in 
power bi desktop.

OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO -- So now we r going to see DAX functions--OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Data Analysis Expressions (commonly known as DAX) is the formula language that drives 
the Power BI front-end.
Add calculated columns (for filtering) and measures (for aggregation) to enhance data models.

M and DAX are two distinct functional languages used within Power BI Desktop:
• M is used in the Power Query editor, and is designed specifically for extracting, transforming and loading data
• DAX is used in the Power BI front-end, and is designed specifically for analyzing relational data models

DAX is a collection of functions, operators, and constants that can be used in a formula, or expression, to calculate
and return one or more values

Y=f(x)
• Build quick measures.
• Create calculated columns.

Following are the requirements for syntax:
1. Scalar constant
2.Reference to column or table
3.Operator
4. Functions and its arguments
5.Expression

Measure_name=DAXFunction(Table_name[Column_Name]
Column_name=Table_name[Column_Name]


Calculated columns allow you to add new, formula-based columns to tables in a model.
Calculated columns generate values for each row, which 
are visible within tables in the Data view.
Calculated columns are typically used for filtering & grouping data


Measures are DAX formulas used to generate new calculated values
Unlike calculated columns, measures aren’t visible within 
tables; they can only be “seen” within a visualization like a chart 
or matrix (similar to a calculated field in a PivotTable)
Measures evaluate based on filter context, which means they 
recalculate when the fields or filters around them change.

Implicit measures are created when you drag raw numerical fields 
into a report visual and manually select an aggregation mode (Sum, 
Average, Min, Max, Count, etc.)

Explicit measures are created when you actually write a DAX formula 
and define a new measure that can be used within the model

Implicit measures are only accessible within the specific visualization 
in which they were created, and cannot be referenced elsewhere
Explicit measures can be used anywhere in the report, and referenced 
by other DAX calculations to create “measure trees”.

logical/text operator--
&-- concatenation
&&-- And
||-- or
in-- or

Calculation Types
• The two types of calculations are calculated columns and calculated measures.
• Calculated columns are based on a single column of data, while calculated measures are
based on multiple columns of data.
• Calculated columns create a new column in your existing table.
e.g. Calculated Column
1. Employee Full Name=Employee[FirstName]& “-”& Employee[LastName]
2. Profit=Sale[SalesAmount]-Sales[CostAmount]
Calculated Measure
1. TotalSale=Sum(Sale[SalesAmount])
2. TotalProfit=Sum(Sale[SalesAmount])-Sum(Sales[CostAmount])

Basic DAX Functions
Aggregate Functions
● MIN
● MAX
● Average
● SUM
● SUMX
Counting Functions
● DISTINCTCOUNT
● COUNT
● COUNTA
● COUNTROWS
● COUNTX
Logical Functions
● AND
● OR
● NOT
● IF
● IFERROR
Text Functions
● REPLACE
● FIND
● UPPER
● FIXED
● CONCATENATE
Basic DAX Functions
DATE Functions
● DATE
● HOUR
● WEEKDAY
● NOW
● EOMONTH
INFORMATION Functions
● ISBLANK
● ISNUMBER
● ISTEXT
● ISNONTEXT
● ISERROR
Advanced DAX Functions
Time intelligence function
• DateAdd
• TotalMTD
Calculate function

In DAX calculation, we can use variables to make the calculations easier to understand.
● Why to use:
1. Improve performance
2. Improve readability
3. Improve debugging
● Structure:
Var varname=expression
Return expression
● Example : New col---
Var_Try = 
VAR varB=2+2
RETURN varB*3



We have excel funcs like vlookup, right, left, concat, sum average,etc
In power bi the lang that we use is DAX. U can open DAX ppt.

Using DAX we can create 2 things-- 1. calculated measures, 2nd calculated columns.

In new measure is created then,
syntax is--
Measure_name- DAXFunction('Table_name'[Column_name]
and for new col--Column_name=Table_name[Column_Name]

Text is written in double quotes.

New measure lets say Total Price-- then it will be like--
eg---
Total Price=SUM('Car details'[Price])

for col-- 
Total Sales = price-discount then we will write like--

TotalSales = 'Car details'[Price]-'Car details'[Discount]

Above is the syntax for writing DAX.

So the diffrent calculation types present in 
DAX funcs are these 2. calculateed measures adn calculated cols.

when we r creating calculated col, it is visible in table.
but when we create a measure, it is not visible,
bcoz we get single value as o/p in measure.
for eg if 10,20,30,40 are the values and we add them,
then we get a single value.

nut in calculated col we get 1 value for each row and so it is visible.

Calculated Column----------------------------------------------------------------
Employee Full Name = Employee[FirstName]&"-"& Employee[LastName]
here we r concatenating first name and last name by hyphen
Profit = Sale[SalesAmount]-Sales[CostAmount]
here we r subtracting values.

Calculated Measure
TotalSale= Sum(Sale[SalesAmount])
TotalProfit=Sum(SAle[SalesAmount])-Sum(Sales[CostAmount])

Measures are visible in data tab but not in visible.

Now to create measure--> u can goto modelling tab-->
here u have option new measure, new column.

Another way is goto table view---> select the table from right
-->lets say i want to create a measure sum of selling price-->
from here also we can create new measure and new col.

So from table view--> car details v3--> new measure-->

Total Price = SUM('Car details v3'[selling_price])
in the data tab-- calculator sugn appears. this is measures.

Next calculated col--
new col--

Price Per Seats = 'Car details v3'[selling_price]/'Car details v3'[seats]

Here new col is added in table. Summation sign.

Now go to report view-- visualization tab-->card visual-->
drag and drop Total Price. U can even put in fields.

if i edit measure to Total Price = SUM('Car details v3'[seats])
then my visualization will aslso change.

Now, new measure-- 
Minimum Price = MIN('Car details v3'[selling_price])

report view--> card visual--> fields--> Minimum Price.

Now difference between Min And MinA.

Minimum Fuel = MIN('Car details v3'[fuel])
report view--> card--> minimum fuel
C is the min value so CNG.

What if we have logical or boolean values. 
like true, false then min will not help, instead MINA will help.
It converts true into 1 and false into 0 in  the backend,
now 0 in min, so ) will be o/p In real life we donot use it much.

From min we can find the minimum of only number/text.

Now MINX--
i.e. d/b min and minx, sum and sumx, max and maxx, average and averagex

in minx we first write table name on which we want to apply then write expression.
So X here is expression, so we r trying to find min value of an expression.

So, min considers all the values and give 1 single o/p.
but minx considers each and every row of the epression,
and then on the basis of that it gives final o/p.

for eg i have 2 cols--
km and Ltrs i.e. how muckh km it ran and how much 
litrs it consumed..

km,ltrs
100,5
200,10
50,2
1000,50
500,15

now in min(km)= 50
lly, min(liters)=2

but wahat if i want to find min of these 2 cols multiplication.
Now bcoz we cant write 2 cols inside min,
 we will use minx--
Minx(Cardetails,[km]*[liters])
so we have row by row multiplication as--
100,5= 500
200,10=2000
50,2=100
1000,50=50000
500,15=7500
now we will get 100 as o/p.

but whatif we pass only 1 col then it works same as min.

car details v3--
new measure-->
Minimum Seats and Price = MINX('Car details v3','Car details v3'[selling_price]*'Car details v3'[seats])

Now gioing to card visuals to see these values--
new card visual--> put min seats and price.

Now lets say i want to find max of selling price - km driven.

1 way is to add a new col, and 

Price_km = 'Car details v3'[selling_price]-'Car details v3'[km_driven]
then we will find max of this col.i.e.
new measure--> max_price_km = MAX('Car details v3'[Price_km])
this will give us 1 value.

now creating another  measure using maxx--

max_price_km_with_x = MAXX('Car details v3','Car details v3'[selling_price]-'Car details v3'[km_driven])

report view-- card --> max_price_km
report view-- card --> max_price_km_with_x

Sum--
new measure--Total_Seats = SUM('Car details v3'[seats])

card visual== total seats

new measure -- car supply-- sum of sales / quantity.
i.e. total sales per quantiyt.

total_sales_per_each_quantity= SUMX('Car_SupplyChainManagement',Car_SupplyChainManagement[Sales]/Car_SupplyChainManagement[Quantity])

see in the card visual.
SAme goes for avg and avgx.

Count functions--

fuel type-- number of items in this func.
Count gives count of all rows except blank rows.
and give single o/p.

Distinct count gives unique count-

See car details v3--> fuel--> in dropdown we can see 4 
values. this is distinct count
but count will give how many times each category is coming.

new measure--
count_of_fuel = COUNT('Car details v3'[fuel])

new measure--
Unique_fuel = DISTINCTCOUNT('Car details v3'[fuel])

add card visuals to see both.

count is giving all the rows except blank.

CountA and count behaves similar.
count rows similar to count only, ignores blank.
countblank counts blank rows.

New measure--
count_blank = COUNTBLANK('Car details v3'[max_power])
card visual

Now other basic DAX functions--
calendar- creates new table for dates.
calendar takes start date and end date
which we will get using another dax func,
where date dax func takes values in year,month,day.
o/p of date depends on power bi settings.

so click new table-->
calendar_table = CALENDAR(DATE(2022,2,1),DATE(2024,2,1))

so the o/p pf date includes time also.
If u dont want, select col--format--> short date

new measure-- date_time = Hour(Now())-- put in a card visual.

then absolute-- abs() and power()

now coming to if-- car details v3--
new column tools-->
manual_condition = IF('Car details v3'[transmission]="Manual","ITV","It is Automatic")

Now inside if we can have and and or.

new measure--
condition_new = IF(AND(10>9,2<3),"Correct","Wrong")
card visual.

if we will change 10<9 then o/p will cahnge to wrong.
lly, we can change and to or, and seee the o/p in card visual.

lly, we have iferror(25/0,"NA",25)

condition_new = IFERROR(25/0,"Division error")
do 25/1 then o/p will change.

so in car sales mgmt--
Column = IFERROR(Car_SupplyChainManagement[Sales]/Car_SupplyChainManagement[Discount],"NA")

Column = IFERROR(Car_SupplyChainManagement[Sales]/Car_SupplyChainManagement[Discount],0.0)

SWITCH Function
1.	Add column Abbr = SWITCH(marks[Subjects],
"Physics","Py",
"Math","Mh",
"Chemistry","Che",
"Computer","Comp","Oth")

Concatenate-- concat 2 texts.
concatenate("First","Name")

Filter-- it returns a filtered table.
 on table -- new table-- Car_type = FILTER('Car sale',[Vehicle_type]="Car")

for multiple conditions u can add conditions with AND.

Car_type = FILTER('Car sale',[Vehicle_type]="Car" && [Manufacturer]="Dodge")

|| or character.

Calculate DAX function--
calculate(expression,filter)

Calculate([Sales Amount],'Product'[Color] IN {"Red","Blue"})

New measure--
Car_type_1 = CALCULATE(SUM('Car sale'[Fuel_capacity]), FILTER('Car sale',[Vehicle_type]="Car" && [Manufacturer]="Dodge"))


RELATED Function
1.	Load Toys details excel file.
2.	Select sales table and select new column, Country = RELATED(Country[CountryName])
3.	Add new column, city = RELATED(City[CityName])
4.	Add new column, Product = RELATED('Product'[ProductName])
5.	Make the change in Country formula, Country =  IF(
        RELATED(Country[CountryName]) = BLANK(),
        "Country not found",
        RELATED(Country[CountryName]))
6.	Make the change in Country formula, Country = IF(
        ISBLANK(RELATED(Country[CountryName])),
        "Country not found",
         RELATED(Country[CountryName]))
RELATEDTABLE Function
1.	Select City table, add new column Number of sales = COUNTROWS(RELATEDTABLE(Sales))
2.	Select Product table, add new column Total Sales = COUNTROWS(RELATEDTABLE(Sales))
3.      Select Country table, add No of Sales = COUNTROWS(RELATEDTABLE(Sales))

Visualization-----------


#-------------- Now adventure works.pbix file--


It already contain some data and is in star schema.
The key values we have hidden bcoz their work is to merge tables.
Now when we will do annalysis on our cust view, we will notsee these keys theri.

This is a huge data.

Report view-- 
1.
from reseller-- put city in values
from product-- put color in values.

this visual is table. This is by default visual.

bar chart and col chart--

stacked col chart--
X-axis-- city
Y-axis-- Sales Amount

If u donot put anything on X-axis, total Sales Amount

U can even do for X-axis-- Reseller--Country-Region
Y-axis-- Sales--SAles Amount
legend--product--color--

Small multiples filed-- is going to divide ur visual into multiple small visuals--
So lets suppose-- based on SAles Order-- Channel. Now channel has hardly 2 values.
Internet and Reseller. SO 2 charts got created.

Instead if we put Product- category on small multiples, then 4 charts gets created.

lly if chart type , u select 100%stack, then it calcs %.

Same thing we can do by clicking on bar.

lly for clucster bar chart.

Next part is formatting visual--
So now lets say I have 100% stacked bar chart--Y-axis -- country region
x-axis-- sales amount, legend color, small multiples-- Category.

format visual--
Most of the time, the customization part is going to be same for diff visuals.

y-axis-- font style, size, bold , italic,color, position is by default on left,
but u can change, 
then title--if u dont want title to come--off.
OPtion is there for x-axis and y-axis too, if u want to see or not.
then we have legend. its position is by default top, u can make it bottom.
lly for small multiples -- make it 1 row, 4 cols.
border-- gridlines--all.
line style--dashed
line colr-grey
line width--8

Background-- color-pink
gridlines-- vertical-solid, color-black, width-4

bars--then data labels--on, in option u can see--insede end, inside center,etc
by plot area bckgrnd u can add background image.

If u want to do customization on entire page then General--
page ka size is changing.
title--u can increase font size.
lly background will give color to entire visual.
shadow effect.

U can even customize tooltip.

Now filter tab-- this u get with visual and as a section too.

so lets say i want to see black blue,multi red silver and yellow.
Now for now in my filter tab , i have--
category,color,countyr-region,sales amount.
Now lets say i want to apply filter on color--we r doing basic filtering--

Sales Amount--<5000 apply.

Clear filter--

now next to filter is focus mode--
putting that particular chart into focus.

Then there are many more options on 3 dots.
So, 3 dots-- export data to csv file.

then whatever values are getting used-- show that as table.

then sort-- sort on multiple axis.
sort ascending, sort descending.

U can even lock the visual.

then line chart and area chart.

Line charts and area charts are for presenting timeline and trends.
Area chart can show the magnitude.
so 1 st line chart--
Date-- Fiscal -- month value--, sales order-- values-- sales order.
now on x-axis keep month
now it is showing count of sales order.
If u want to see sales -- values unit price--

So as my sales order is increasing,my unit price is decreasing.

This is the trend.

Now put area chart-- put same values--

If u want to see ur visual, then u can do the focus mode.

and then u have option of spotlight, where, other visual is getting hidden.

Now in line chart--keep count of sales order-- in legend put color

Now put stacked area chart-- put the same values.
x-axis- month, y-axis---count of sales order, unit price.

then u can combine col chart and line chart--
x- axis--month,
y- axes-- sales amount
then line y-axis-- unit price.

When sales amt is less, unit price is increased.
Increasing sales amount-- decreasing unit price.
In customization -- mostly options are same, there is zoom slider.
right click on this visual-- analyze--and u can see where exactly it is diffe.

this is the AI component of PowerBI.

U can also summarize.

SO u can see and keep the summary.

then, coming onto zoom slider--on, y-axis, seciondry y-axis.

So, ribbion chart--x-axis-month, y-axis-- count of sales order,legend-color
Ribbion chart is generally used to know high rank and low rank.

Waterfall chart-- category-- month,breakdown-color,y-axis--sales amount
total sales here is for month of july
u can also do breakdown using color.

Next is funnel chart--
so earlier we have seen filter on 1 chart.
U can also have filters for all the visuals on a page.
So. filter-- filter on this page--
drag month on this page.
now it is getting applied on both.
what if we want filter to be affected on another page too--
So put filter on all the pages-- month

Next is funnel chart--bubble chart--
Funnel chart represents the flow of the linear process on
sequential stages.

Category-Facial Quarter,Values- sales amt
In a group , u can also put color.

Scatter plot--values--x-axis-sales aount,y-axis-unit price
legend -color size-unit price--

Now in play axis-- put month.

for every month, pie chart--legend--color,values-count of sales order
or u can even put legend- country

Filter-- country-- top n-- show items-- top 3,by value--first sales order-- apply filter

donut chart-- legend-country-- values-- count of sales order--
legend-- country,values--sales amt,unit price

tree map chart-- values-- 
category-category,details-month,values-sales order

Card visual-- Sales Amount

Table and Matrix Visual--  
In table we have only col header,
but in matrix we have col header and row header.
table-- values-- color,  sales amount
Table also supports conditional formatting.
So click on table -- right click on color--conditional formatting

SO in table put-- customer-- customer, and sales-- sales amount.
--


matrix-- country region,then color, values- sales amount.
matrix goives kind of a pivot like structure.

Matrix also provide drill down
So the hierarchy that we created--
so in rows put geography.
Click on the plus sign and see.

then slicer-- color
visual-- slicer--tile-- so it looks like button.
Now in view-- sync slicer-- select all those pages where u want it to apply.
if u will untick this eye part, then this slicer will not be visible in diff pages.

See in lecture folder-- Adventure-works 27-03 is the finished work.

Maps-- integrated with bing maps.
sales table-- we have countyr data
country-region-- state-province

So, report view--filled map--location -- put from customer table-- customer-regionok
In the bubble size-put sales amount.
This map u can also call as bubble.
Next is filled map--put- country-- country-region.

Themes are applied to all.
Select any page-- select theme-- it applied.

custom tool tip-- new page-- format paint brush option--switch on allow use as tooltip
now rename page as tooltip page--select page view-- actual size
now in visualization tab--goto format-- expand canvas settings-- selct type as tooltip
Come back to canvas and put--pie visual--customer t--country-region, sales order--sales order
now how to apply this on visuals--
now select any visual where u will aply this tooltip--
Now lets say in my line and area chart-- i want to add this tooltip--
so select the format option of the visual--goto general tab--tooltip--options--on page-- select customtooltip
now comeback to customtooltip page-- click on pie--format--visual--options--label contents--category,datavalue

Then show text box--
then image box
then arrow can be used to perform some action, type- page navigation, dest-funnel chart== ctrl+click arrow.

now goto pie_donut-Tree chart--filter-- filter on this page--put channel-- now tick internet--
now this i want to bookmark-- so view-- bookmark--Add-- now u can rename-- Internet Filter
now deselect all--now if u will click on bookmark -- see o/p-- u can clear filter

now goto card visual matrix--insert--buttons tab-- bookmark-- now click on this bookmark--
button--action--action type bookmark, bookmark--internet filter
Now when we will click on this bookmark--it will take to another page--with applied filter.

now open-- retail analysis----

there is a table sales-- all the measures are present in it.
It contains--last year sales and this year sales.

then show card, gauge,line chart.

then in District-- we have district manager--
now put DM in values-- change text size-- now images r in cloud which we will access by url.
then put DM_pic_fl
Now if u will remove names, only images will remain.

So now add slicer-- dm_pic_fl-- options-tile

now lets say u want to see diff district manager's performance--
So, col chart-- x-axis-DM, y-axis--Total Stores
u can put storetype in legend. or fiscal month-- u can also take clustered col chart.

give assignment folder-- ch 6--countries flag

Next is to work with python in pbi-- 1st we need to install python, after that install python libraries--
pandas and matplotlib,
in cmd prompt--pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
then enable python script--file--optionsAndSettings-option-python script--ok
ensure the path of the python location--
C:\Users\hp\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.12_qbz5n2kfra8p0--ok

now run python script to get the data.
So, get data--more--now in the pbi only pandas df data can be loaded nothing else not tuple,list,tuple,etc.
no way of giving input to pbi script, it shouldnot be too lengthy.

so, get data-- search-- python-- click-python script--connect-- in the dialog box write some py script.

        import pandas as pd
	data = [['Harry',45],['Mike',67],['Ron',34]]
	df = pd.DataFrame(data,columns=['Name','Marks'],dtype=float)

or,

import pandas as pd 
df = pd.DataFrame({ 
    'Fname':['Harry','Sally','Paul','Abe','June','Mike','Tom'], 
    'Age':[21,34,42,18,24,80,22], 
    'Weight': [180, 130, 200, 140, 176, 142, 210], 
    'Gender':['M','F','M','M','F','M','M'], 
    'State':['Washington','Oregon','California','Washington','Nevada','Texas','Nevada'],
    'Children':[4,1,2,3,0,2,0],
    'Pets':[3,2,2,5,0,1,5] 
}) 
print (df)

load it,, now u can create any visual based on this.

Now institutes, for clening process many times use python.

U can also bring some python visuals.

Now create a new page-- page name-- python visual-- now in visualization-- we have py--
Enable script visuals-- enable--
and the script editor opens--

then try--

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
dataset.plot(kind='pie', x='Gender', y='Weight', color='red')
plt.show() 


pbi q&a--

in q&a search-- awesome pets and children age.

Gateway servers are for connecting my sql machines with pbi cloud servers.
This is not required til we r working on pbi desktop.
But when we go on cloud, then 1st establist data gateway.

Dashboard-----------


Dashboard-------------- Financial Sample.xlsx -- Financials

So 1st transform data to check if its clean--
So there is no missing data.

1st take Text Box-- ABC Financial Executive Report
-- Font is blue color.

Then we need horizontal line--from style u can choose blue colr

Then we need vertical line-- So,
shapes-- new line-- shape-- rotation--90
and arange it.

So now we have

Now on the left , we have countries slicer--
U can do setting of slicer for similar color.

Next is Power Q&A.

Now Right hand side of vertical line-- we have 3 gauges.
Sales, Profit and Unit Sold

So 1st gauage--sales-- By going into General proprty
u can change heading size and all by Title.
From the visual , u can change visual settings.

Next is for Profit.
Change callout value and all to bold and keep same.

Next is Unit Sold.

Next is Clustered Col Chart--
x-axis--Discount Band
y-axis-- Units Sold and Discounts

Now if u want labels--on data labels.

Next line chart is there--
X-axis-- Month Name,
Y-axis-- Sales, Profit

Small multiples-- Product

Next we will take matrix--rows-- Segment
values-- COGS
Do adjustment of visual-- values,row header, col header

Now for each visual u can give some shadow image, 
or watermark .

U can put some questions on Q and A and it will answer.
Like -- Total Sales.

Z-order Formatting--Z order formatting
• Just like Power Point you can manage the front-to-back order of visuals in a report, often referred to 
as the z-order of elements
• This feature lets you overlap visuals in any way you want, then adjust the front-to-back order of each 
one.

So when the charts overlap,For applying this,
format--Send it backwards,bring forward.

But best is make dashboard so that u dont have to use it.

It ask for debit/credit card credentials.

powerfabric

Load-- Sample-EU Store-- Orders Sheet--
files-- options and settigns-- python Scripting--

To start scripting 1st put values in values.

So put Sales and Profit in Values
